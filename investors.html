  <h1>Investor Advisory Services</h1>
</header>

<main>

  <p>
    SH Business Management Limited provides independent, strategic advisory
    services to property investors operating across the UK and Northern Ireland.
  </p>

  <p>
    We support investors at every stage of the investment lifecycle, from
    feasibility and acquisition through to compliance oversight and portfolio
    performance review.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Investor-Focused Support</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pre-acquisition feasibility and risk assessment</li>
    <li>HMO suitability and licensing advisory</li>
    <li>Regulatory and compliance guidance</li>
    <li>Portfolio structure and governance review</li>
    <li>Strategic growth and exit planning</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Independent & Partner-Led Delivery</h2>
  <p>
    SH Business Management Limited does not act as a managing agent or property
    operator. Where delivery services are required, we work alongside trusted,
    regulated partner organisations.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ensures investors benefit from clear separation between advisory,
    compliance oversight and operational delivery.
  </p>

  <h2>Public Sector & Institutional Alignment</h2>
  <p>
    Our approach aligns with local authority expectations, lender requirements
    and public sector governance standards, making our services suitable for
    institutional and professional investors.
