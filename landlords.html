    <h2>Partner-Led Managing Agent Support</h2>
    <p>
        Where property management services are required, SH Business Management Limited works exclusively
        with vetted, independent managing agents through a partner-led model.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are <strong>not a managing agent</strong>. Management, repairs and day-to-day operations are
        delivered by regulated third-party partners, ensuring transparency, accountability and full
        compliance with UK property regulations.
